MyKit
=====

## INTRODUCTION

__MyKit__ is a wide-ranged collection of codes from extensions to small modular frameworks that are covering from data structure to user interface.

## ABOUT

This library was originally just for organizing the common boilerplate codes in my Swift development workflow; and it has been growing larger over years. If there is a __generic__ solution for an implementation, it likely will end up here.

This is more or less an educational diary of mine to programming; but most importantly it is an essential arsenal for any of my Swift project.
