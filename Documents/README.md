MyKit
=====

## INTRODUCTION

__MyKit__ is a wide-ranged collection of codes from native APIs extensions to frameworks covering from data structure to user interface.

## ABOUT

This library was originally for organizing all of the common codes in Swift development. However over the year, it has been growing rapidly and becoming a track record of all APIs that I have ever worked on. Every time there is a possibility of a __generic__ implementation it will end up here.

This is more or less an educational diary of mine to the programming world since I started out from a nontechnical background; and most importantly it is an essential pocket arsenals that I use in daily based tasks.

Happy Coding!
