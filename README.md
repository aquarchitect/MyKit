**MyKit** was originally made to centralize reusable codes for my developments. It has been growing strong over the year, and now it not 
only contains high-leveled helper functions on top of *CloudKit*, *CoreData*, and many others; but also includes a wide variety of 
frameworks ranging from data structure to user interface that will ease every-day iOS/OSX development. Every elements is carefully designed 
to be functional and modular.

Some of the highlights: [Promise](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/blob/master/MyKit/Utility/Promise.swift), [LoremIpsum](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/LoremIpsum), [OpenWeather](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/OpenWeather)...

Even though unnecessary files on different projects can produce extra-overhead, it keeps the codes less fragmented. Categorization into 
smaller modules is already planned to implement for a near future.
