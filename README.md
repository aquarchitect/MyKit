#### About

This library was originally a simple repository for me to organize all of the common boiler-plate codes throughout my Swift development career. Over the years, it has been growing and becoming a track record of all APIs that I have ever worked on. Every time there is a possibility of a __generic__ implementation it will end up in here. __MyKit__ now covers a wide range of aspects in Swift development world from data structure to user interface.

__MyKit__ is more or less an educational diary of mine to the development world from a nontechnical background; and most importantly it is an essential pocket arsenals I use in day-to-day tasks.

Even though its name sounds personal, I have removed the "I" in this project in order to welcome to everyone to check out and perhaps play with it.

Happy Coding!
