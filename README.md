#### About

This library was simply a place for me to store and organize all of the common boiler-plate codes. Over the years, it has been growing rapidly and becoming a track record of all APIs that I have ever worked on. Every time there is a possibility for a __generic__ implementation it will end up here. __MyKit__ now covers a wide range of Swift development aspects from data structure to user interface.

__MyKit__ is more or less an educational diary of mine to the field started out from a nontechnical background; and most importantly it is an essential pocket arsenals that I use in day-to-day tasks.

Even though its name sounds personal, I have tried to remove the "I" in this project in order to welcome to everyone to check out and perhaps use it.

Happy Coding!
