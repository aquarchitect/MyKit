**MyKit** was originally made for centralizing reusable codes during my developments. It has been growing strong over the year, and now it not only contains high-leveled helper functions on top of *CloudKit*, *CoreData*..., but also includes a wide variety of frameworks ranging from data structure to user interface that will ease every-day iOS/OSX development. Every elements is carefully designed in such a modularity manner, and always maintained with up-to-date version of Swift.

Some of the highlights: [Promise](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/blob/master/MyKit/Utility/Promise.swift), [LoremIpsum](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/LoremIpsum), [OpenWeather](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/OpenWeather)...

Even though unnecessary files on different projects can produce extra-overhead, it keeps the codes less fragmented. Categorizing into smaller modules is already planned to implement in a very near future.
