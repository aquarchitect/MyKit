**MyKit** represents a centralized source for reusable code I often find myself using in personal projects. It has been growing strong over the year, and now it not only contains high-level helper functions on top of *CloudKit*, *CoreData* and other standard libraries, but also a wide variety of frameworks that assist in many aspects of everyday iOS/OSX development, including data structures and user interface development. Every element is carefully designed to be modular, and each is maintained with an up-to-date version of Swift.

Some highlights: [Promise](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/blob/master/MyKit/Utility/Promise.swift), [LoremIpsum](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/LoremIpsum), [OpenWeather](https://github.com/aquarchitect/MyKit/tree/master/MyKit/Framework/OpenWeather)...

Even though unnecessary files on different projects can produce extra-overhead, it keeps the code less fragmented. Categorization into smaller modules is already planned for the very near future.
